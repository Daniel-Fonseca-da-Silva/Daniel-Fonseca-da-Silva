I am a computer engineer currently residing in Portugal. Since childhood, I have always been fascinated by technology and algorithms. This passion led me into the world of programming at an early age, where I absorbed knowledge through reading specialized books, particularly in data structures.

In my youth, I began my educational journey by participating in in-person courses, covering topics such as networks and operating systems, as well as online courses. Determined to turn my passion into practice, I started developing my own projects.

In the field of front-end development, I am highly skilled in creating attractive and functional user interfaces. I use technologies such as HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to develop responsive and user-friendly web applications. My experience includes using popular frameworks like NextJS and Angular, enabling the creation of cutting-edge web applications. I am also proficient in using Bootstrap and Tailwind to ensure responsive and user-friendly design.

Regarding back-end development, I specialize in using technologies such as Java and Spring. I can build robust APIs and scalable web applications using these tools. Additionally, I have knowledge in NestJS, a Node.js framework for building efficient and well-structured server-side applications.

I have solid experience in databases, including PostgreSQL, Redis, and MySQL. I can design and model efficient databases, ensuring proper storage and retrieval of data for complex applications.

In addition to my technical skills, I excel in supporting and guiding junior developers. I am always willing to share my knowledge and help the team grow and develop. My experience includes teamwork, providing guidance, and solving technical challenges.

An essential aspect of my work is the continuous improvement of both front-end and back-end web systems. I am always seeking opportunities to optimize and enhance the performance, usability, and security of the applications I develop. I stay updated on industry best practices and trends, ensuring that the systems I build align with the highest quality standards.
